        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>I have worked on one project so far.</p>
        <li>A Database for a Farmer</li>

        <p>I designed a database for farmers to be able to manage the affairs of their farm(s).
            Farmers would be able to track their produce, equipment and the attendance of workers.
